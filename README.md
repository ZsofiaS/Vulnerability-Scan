# Vulnerability scan
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZsofiaS/Vulnerability-Scan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZsofiaS/Vulnerability-Scan)

## Technologies and design

The app has been built with React Hooks, and tested with Jest and Enzyme.
I used Travis for continuous integration.
The scan results page consists of the following main sections:
* top bar: contains user information & notifications
* summary: contains general information about the scan
* scan details: list of vulnerabilities and details

My main goal was to write clean, readable, structured code.  
Note: I assumed that the .json payload is never empty, and the json structure is the same as in the example provided.

## To run locally

* In your terminal, type
```
git clone https://github.com/ZsofiaS/Vulnerability-Scan.git
```
* navigate to the project directory 'Vulnerability-Scan', then type
```
npm install
```
to install all required node modules.
* Then type
```
npm start
```
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## To run the tests

* In your terminal, type
```
npm test
```
This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## Specification

With a .json payload provided, which contains user & scan information, mock up an interface that consumes this data and displays it in the browser.

## Possible next steps:
* to make the page fully responsive
* to use a CSS preprocessor for styling
